# Flocking Simulation

The flocking algorithm mimics behaviors commonly seen in nature. A typical example of this behavior is the flight of birds in a flock. 

## 1 - Goals
- In this coding challenge, I will create a flocking simulation in Flutter based on Craig Reynolds "boids" algorithm. Inspired by [The Coding Train Challenge - Flocking Simulation by Daniel Shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/124-flocking-simulation)

- Understand and practice how the flutter engine draws the UI behind the scenes.
